<h1>Programming corinet</h1>
<p><tt>corinet</tt> defines a rudimentary API that allows to easily add new network 
  and task elements to the existing package in so-called <em>sandboxes</em>. Sandboxes 
  allow to test these new elements without disturbing the existing code.</p>
<p>It also has build-in mechanisms for semi-automatic code generation.</p>
<p>I will explain this as soon as possible.</p>
