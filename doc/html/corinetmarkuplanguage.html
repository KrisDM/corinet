<h1> corinet Markup Language</h1>
<p>The <tt>corinet</tt> markup language specifies several file formats:</p>
<p>Files of type <a href="./experimentList/experimentList.html">&lt;experimentList&gt;</a> 
  contain 1 or more references to experiment files. Each of these experiment files 
  is executed in the order of their appearance in the list file.</p>
<p>Files of type <a href="./experimentSetup/experimentSetup.html">&lt;experiment&gt;</a> 
  contain the definitions of networks, tasks, and descriptions of how networks 
  and tasks are combined in an execution.</p>
<p>Files of type <a href="./languageDefinition/languageDefinition.html">&lt;languageDefinition&gt;</a> 
  serve two purposes: firstly, they define additional constraints on the validity 
  of experiment files by defining admissable types and parameters for specific 
  network and task elements. Secondly, files of this type can serve to generate 
  C++ classes for new network and task elements.</p>
<p>The main languageDefinition file <a href="../code/xml/Definition/languageDefinition.xml">(languageDefinition.xml</a>) 
  contains all currently supported network and tasks elements. It provides additional 
  information on how to write experiment setup files. Other languageDefinition 
  files are local to the system and form, together with the C++ code generated 
  from them, <em>sandboxes</em> for testing of new network and task elements.</p>
<p>Files of type <a href="./resultsFile/resultsFile.html">&lt;results&gt;</a> 
  contain the results of experiments.</p>
