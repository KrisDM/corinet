<h1>Installation Guidelines</h1>
<h2>1. Preparing for installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make a directory to hold all files for the <tt>corinet</tt> project.</li>
  <li>Define an environment variable <tt>CORINETROOT</tt> (in capitals) pointing 
    to this directory.</li>
  <li>Make a <tt>$CORINETROOT/bin</tt> directory and add it to your search path.</li>
  <li> <tt>corinet</tt> uses the Xerces-C xml parser library (version 2.7.0). 
    Download from <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/">here</a> and follow 
    the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html">installation</a> 
    instructions.<br/>
    When the build process was successful, do the following: 
    <ul>
      <li> On Windows: copy <tt>xerces-c.lib</tt> and <tt>xerces-c_2_7.dll</tt> 
        to the <tt>$CORINETROOT/bin</tt> directory. The .lib file is created as 
        <tt>xerces-c_2.lib</tt>, so name should be changed. </li>
      <li> On Linux: copy <tt>libxerces-c.so.27.0</tt> to a directory in the <tt>LIB_SEARCH_PATH</tt>, 
        e.g. <tt>/usr/lib</tt>. </li>
      <li> On other Unix systems requirements are similar: a '.so' or '.sl' file 
        included in the search path of the dynamic loader. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> The <tt>corinet</tt> project can be build from the command line using the 
    <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> build system. A source distribution 
    of Boost Build V2 is included in <tt>$CORINETROOT/tools/boost-build</tt>. 
    Boost Build itself can be build from the command line by changing to the <tt>$CORINETROOT/tools/boost-build/jam_src</tt> 
    directory and executing <tt>build.bat</tt> (on Windows) or <tt>build.sh</tt> 
    (on Unix). These scripts build the <tt>bjam</tt> executable in <tt>$CORINETROOT/tools/boost-build/jam_src/bin.XXX</tt>, 
    where <tt>XXX</tt> is a platform dependent suffix. Copy <tt>bjam</tt> from 
    that location to a location in the search path (e.g. to <tt>$CORINETROOT/bin</tt>)<br/>
    To configure <tt>bjam</tt> for your compiler, go to <tt>$CORINETROOT/tools/boost-build</tt>, 
    open <tt>user-config.jam</tt> in a text editor and uncomment one of the 'using' 
    lines: e.g., for compilation with gcc, uncomment <tt>'using gcc ;'</tt> and 
    comment out (with #) all other options. If your compiler is not listed, please 
    refer to the Boost Build documentation files. </li>
</ol>


<h2>2. Building corinet</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Unzip the <tt>corinet.zip</tt> or <tt>corinet.tar.gz</tt> archive inside 
    the <tt>CORINETROOT</tt> directory. </li>
  <li> To build <tt>corinet</tt> from the command line using Boost Build V2, make 
    sure <tt>bjam</tt> is installed as described above. Go to <tt>$CORINETROOT/projects/boost/console/</tt> 
    and execute the command <tt>bjam</tt>. This causes the file <tt>Jamroot</tt> 
    to be read and its build commands to be executed. As a result, the <tt>corinet</tt> 
    executable is built and copied to <tt>$CORINETROOT/bin</tt>. All intermediate 
    files are stored inside <tt>$CORINETROOT/build</tt>. Recompilation and relinking 
    of <tt>corinet</tt> can be performed in the same way. Newly added sandbox 
    C++ (.cpp) files are automatically included in the compilation process if 
    they reside in <tt>$CORINETROOT/sandboxes/XXX/</tt>, where <tt>XXX</tt> is 
    the name of any subdirectory. <br/>
    Executing <tt>bjam debug</tt> causes a debug version to be build inside the 
    <tt>$CORINETROOT/build</tt> directory, but it is not copied to <tt>$CORINETROOT/bin</tt>. 
    <br/>
    <tt>bjam clean</tt> cleans all intermediate files and forces a rebuild on 
    the next build. <br/>
    If compilation or linking fails, see the <tt>Jamroot</tt> file for possible 
    causes.</li>
  <li> If you are using an alternative development environment, such as <tt>Visual 
    Studio</tt>, <tt>C++Builder</tt> or <tt>CodeWarrior</tt>, please put project 
    files in a directory inside <tt>$CORINETROOT/projects</tt>, intermediate build 
    files inside <tt>$CORINETROOT/build/console</tt>, and the release executable 
    in <tt>$CORINETROOT/bin</tt>. This will ensure minimal disruption during future 
    upgrades. </li>
  <li> At the command, type <tt>corinet -t</tt>. If the test is succesful, the 
    program is ready to use! </li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Integration with Matlab</h2>
M scripts for integration with <tt>Matlab</tt> (running <tt>corinet</tt> from 
the <tt>Matlab</tt> command prompt, reading and writing results and patternSets) 
can be found in <tt>$CORINETROOT/code/matlab</tt>. To use these scripts, add directory 
<tt>$CORINETROOT/code/matlab</tt> to the <tt>Matlab</tt> search path. 
<h2>4. Integration with R</h2>
Similar scripts are provided for integration with <tt>R</tt> in <tt>$CORINETROOT/code/r</tt>. 
To make them available in the <tt>R</tt> workspace, source the file <tt>sourceCorinet.R</tt> 
at the start of each session.
