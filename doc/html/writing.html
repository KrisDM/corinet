<h1>Writing &lt;experiment&gt; Files</h1>
<p>Files containing the setup information for experiments are written in an xml 
  file format specified by the <tt>corinet</tt> markup language. Familiarity with 
  xml concepts, such as elements, tags, attributes, schemas etc. is required.</p>
<p>Currently, information for writing setup files comes from three sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="./experimentSetup/experimentSetup.html">documentation</a> generated 
    from the experimentSetup.xsd schema file</li>
  <li>the official <a href="../../code/xml/Definition/languageDefinition.xml">languageDefinition.xml</a> 
    file defines and documents further constraints on admissible types of network 
    and task elements.</li>
  <li>the experiments from published <a href="./papers.html">papers</a> in <tt>$CORINETROOT/examples/Experiments</tt>.These 
    examples are grouped by paper and are well documented. Earlier papers contain 
    simple experiments and are thus simulated with simple setup files. Later papers 
    contain more complex experiments and use more complex features from the <tt>corinet</tt> 
    markup language.</li>
</ul>
