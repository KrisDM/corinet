Contents of this folder:
- <experiment> setup files (see individual files for specific info):
	AFFig2.xml
	BarsFig3.xml

- Matlab m-scripts:
	AFFig2.m

Running the m-scripts will run the corresponding experiment using CORINET, read the data into matlab 
and plot the results in a form similar to the figures in the original paper.

If you do not have matlab, run the individual setup files using CORINET, then look at the results in 
the corresponding results files created by CORINET in this folder.
