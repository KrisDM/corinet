Experiment from "A feedback model of visual attention", Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 16(2):219-37,2004.
Contents of this folder:
- <experiment> setup files (see individual files for specific info):
	Exp1.xml
	Exp2.xml
	Exp3.xml
	Exp4.xml

- <experimentList> file:
	ListAll.xml (lists all 4 experiments)

- <typeDefaults> file:
	typeDefaults.xml

- Matlab m-scripts:
	Exp1.m
	Exp2.m
	Exp3.m
	Exp4.m
	ListAll.m (runs all 4 experiments)

- Helper matlab functions
	attenuationTime.m

Running the m-scripts will run the corresponding experiment using corinet, read the data into matlab 
and plot the results in a form similar to the figures in the original paper.

If you do not have matlab, run the list file or individual setup files using corinet, then look at the results in 
the corresponding ExpXXXResults.xml files created by corinet in this folder. 

There are some slight differences between the results generated by corinet and the results used to generate the
figures in the paper. It is not known where these differences come from, but corinet does implement correctly
- as far as described - the network and experimentation methodology from the paper.
