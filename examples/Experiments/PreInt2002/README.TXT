Experiments from "Pre-integration lateral inhibition enhances unsupervised learning", Neural Computation 14(9): 2157-79,2002.
Contents of this folder:
- <experiment> setup files (see individual files for specific info):
	Exp1.xml
	BarsFig34.xml
	BarsFig56.xml
	BarsFootnote3.xml
	BarsFig78.xml

- <experimentList> file:
	ListAll.xml (lists all 5 experiments)

- Matlab m-scripts:
	Exp1.m
	BarsFig56.m

Running the m-scripts will run the corresponding experiment using CORINET, read the data into matlab 
and plot the results in a form similar to the figures in the original paper.

If you do not have matlab, run the list file or individual setup files using CORINET, then look at the results in 
the corresponding results files created by CORINET in this folder.
