Experiments from "Dendritic Inhibition Enhances Neural Coding Properties", Cerebral Cortex 11(12): 1144-9,2001.
Contents of this folder:
- <experiment> setup files (see individual files for specific info):
	Exp1.xml
	Exp2.xml
	Exp3.xml
	Exp4.xml

- <experimentList> file:
	ListAll.xml (lists all 4 experiments)

- Matlab m-scripts:
	Exp1.m
	Exp2.m
	Exp3.m
	Exp4.m
	ListAll.m (runs all 4 experiments)

Running the m-scripts will run the corresponding experiment using CORINET, read the data into matlab 
and plot the results in a form similar to the figures in the original paper.

If you do not have matlab, run the list file or individual setup files using CORINET, then look at the results in 
the corresponding ExpXXXResults.xml files created by CORINET in this folder.
